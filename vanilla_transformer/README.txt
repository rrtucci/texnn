This directory was created with texnn in order
to show how transformer architectures can be
visualized as causal DAGs (Bayesian Networks).

This example of texnn usage is based on the blog post
@article{weng2023transformer,
  title   = "The Transformer Family Version 2.0",
  author  = "Weng, Lilian",
  journal = "lilianweng.github.io",

  month   = "Jan",
  url     = "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-01-27-the-transformer-family-v2/"
}

This example of texnn usage was written for a chapter of my
free, open source book Bayesuvius.
