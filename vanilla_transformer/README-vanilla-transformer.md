This "vanilla transformer" 
example of texnn usage was written for a chapter of my
free, open source book [Bayesuvius](https://github.com/rrtucci/Bayesuvius).

The example is based on the following blog post

    @article{weng2023transformer,
      title   = "The Transformer Family Version 2.0",
      author  = "Weng, Lilian",
      journal = "lilianweng.github.io",
      year    = "2023",
      month   = "Jan",
      url     = "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-01-27-the-transformer-family-v2/"
    }

It uses this figure from that blogpost
