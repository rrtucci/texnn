texnn (pronounced like "Texan") is a Python script that outputs LaTex (tex)
strings for visualizing a Neural Net (nn) as a causal DAG (Bayesian Network).

texnn is capable of reproducing with ease most of the xy-pic generated bnets 
(Bayesian Networks) displayed in my book [Bayesuvius](https://github.com/rrtucci/Bayesuvius).

texnn is a stand-alone app. I wrote it specifically to aid me in writing a 
chapter on transformer architectures (see directory "vanilla_transformer") 
for my free, open source book Bayesuvius. But I soon realized that it could 
be easily converted into a general tool that is independent of the transformer 
topic and of Bayesuvius.

texnn uses the LaTex package xy-pic for drawing.
