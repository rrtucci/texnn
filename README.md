texnn (pronounced like "Texan") is a Python script that outputs LaTex (tex)
strings for visualizing a Neural Net (nn) as a Bayesian Network.

Although texnn is stand-alone, I wrote it specifically to aid me in writing
a chapter on transformer architectures for my free, open source book 
[Bayesuvius](https://github.com/rrtucci/Bayesuvius).

texnn uses the LaTex package XYPic for drawing.
